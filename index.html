I am currently a PhD candidate at Northeastern University in the <a href="https://seclab.nu/" target="_blank">NEU SecLab</a> where I am advised by <a href="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/kirda-engin/" target="_blank">Engin Kirda</a>.
I also work as a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://software.imdea.org/" target="_blank">IMDEA Software Institute</a> under supervision of <a href="https://mguarnieri.github.io/" target="_blank">Marco Guarnieri</a>.

<br /><br />
My primary research interests are in program analysis and formal methods.
Specifically, I am interested in developing techniques to mitigate classes of vulerabilities while being able to formally reason about given properties.
