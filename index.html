        I am currently a PhD candidate at Northeastern University in the <a href="https://seclab.nu/" target="_blank">NEU SecLab</a> where I am advised by <a href="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/kirda-engin/" target="_blank">Engin Kirda</a>.
        I also work as a visiting researcher at the <a href="https://software.imdea.org/" target="_blank">IMDEA Software Institute</a> under supervision of <a href="https://mguarnieri.github.io/" target="_blank">Marco Guarnieri</a>.

        My primary research interests lie in the intersection of program analysis and formal methods.
        Specifically, I am interested in developing techniques to mitigate classes of vulnerabilities in software while simultaneously enabling formal reasoning about desired properties.
